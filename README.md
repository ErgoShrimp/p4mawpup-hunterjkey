You NEED to have a virtual envirenment to run this
Downlaod WebScraper.py into a Notepad++ document and save it into the folder that has your virtual envirenment. ANYWHERE ELSE AND IT WON"T WORK.
Open your virtual envirenment that houses Webscraper.py and type/paste "pip install BeautifulSoup4" into the command line
wait for it to download
