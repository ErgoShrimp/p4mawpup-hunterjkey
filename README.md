1) You NEED to have a virtual envirenment to run this
2) Download WebScraper.py into a Notepad++ document and save it into the folder that has your virtual envirenment. ANYWHERE ELSE AND IT WON"T WORK.
3) Open your virtual envirenment that houses Webscraper.py and type/paste "pip install BeautifulSoup4" into the command line
4) Wait for it to download
5) Type "Python WebScraper.py" into the command line and follow the commands within the program
6) Enjoy!
